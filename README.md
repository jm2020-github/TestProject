	TestProject
	This project contains a Java class with the following methods:
	1) findLongestWord that returns the longest word in a given sentence and its length
	2) findShortestWord that returns the shortest word in a given sentence and its length
	The project also contains a Junit test class which tests the above methods
	
	Assumptions:
	1) If more than 1 word has longest or shortest string, return any
	2) Punctuation would be counted as part of the word, e.g. if the sentence is "The cow jumped over the moon...", moon... would be the longest word
	3) Input string to be supplied from console, or default sentence "The cow jumped over the moon..." is used
